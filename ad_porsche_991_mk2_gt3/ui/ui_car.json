  "description": "Porsche 991 mk2 GT3 Touring Package<br><br>Well what do we have?<br>One step closer to perfection, the finest GT3 yet, the makeover of the generation one, the new &#39;17 model year of the GT3 991. <br>The 991 gen one was by far and away the most successful GT3 to date and we were overwhelmed by the success - it boosted the religion to another level. <br>(Andreas Preuninger)<br><br>Many have still never heard of it. Some believe it’s all just a myth. For the true fan, though, behind the idyllic green hills of the Swabian region in Germany the promised land does exist: Flacht. The home of Porsche Motorsport. The place in which the Porsche heart beats the fastest. Where the transfer from motorsport into series production is routine daily practice. Where the proving ground is our playground. And precision is our greatest passion.<br><br>Here, in Flacht, is where the new 911 GT3 turned its first laps. Here is where the mighty sound of its 4.0-litre horizontally opposed and naturally aspirated engine roared for the first time. Here is where the chassis was tuned over the course of countless test kilometres with the meticulous scrutiny only otherwise afforded to the Porsche 919 Hybrid for Le Mans.<br><br>Porsche&#39;s engineers invested all their racing experience into it, tweaking and honing into the night. Afterwards, they would all say: “It couldn’t get any better.” Only to ask themselves the next morning: “Could we not make it even better?” A hundredth of a second faster, a percentage point more agile, a gram lighter?<br><br>Then – and only then – could we award the highest distinction there is at Porsche: Born in Flacht.",
